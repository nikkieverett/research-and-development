> "I'm insane and responsible! This is a potent combination."

Much like David and Linda Howard (Albert Brooks and Julie Hagerty) in Lost in America, we're getting ready to drop out of society and get Lost in America. Although we won't be driving a Winnebago to the Hoover Dam, there will be lots of great stops along the way and we're really excited to share them with you here. One thing that we'll be avoiding? Nikki taking the nest egg to the roulette table! Actually, we'll just skip the gambling altogether.

Since we're just getting started on the road, we've included some previous trips on our timeline page. Enjoy the pictures from some of our prior adventures while we get through Big Bend and hopefully get some internets back in NM.

Until next time... Cheers to "finding ourselves!" Also, here is the transcript from the exact conversation we had when we decided to embark on this journey.

> RYAN: Nikki! 
>
> {Nikki looks up.}
>
> NIKKI: God, you scared me.
>
> RYAN: Nikki, come here. (he pulls her up by her shoulders) Quit.  Quit, right now.  We're getting out.
>
> NIKKI: What?
>
> RYAN: Now.  Quit.
>
> NIKKI: Quit?
>
> RYAN: Now.  Come on. I did.  Now, you do it.
>
> NIKKI: You did? You quit your job?
>
> RYAN: Surprised, aren't you?  You wouldn't have believed me.  You would've loved it.  No more me.  No more waiting. No more responsible Ryan.  Jesus, they were leading me down a dead-end street!  I've been on the wrong road. I realize what you meant.  I've been too responsible.  So responsible, God! I've been responsibly blind!
>
> NIKKI: I never would've used the word responsible if I thought you would have taken it so literally.  It was just a word.  I really didn't mean anything by it.
>
> RYAN: Stop.  Don't do this.  Don't.  I'm giving you the credit.  You did mean it and you were right. I don't know where the hell I've been for the last ten years.  What happened to me?  I lost the feeling of life.  Jesus, I was being jacked off.  Nikki, they were just jacking me off!
>
> {Ryan's voice is a bit loud.  We can see people look from other offices.}
>
> NIKKI: Honey, shh. (whispering) A little lower, please?
>
> RYAN: (whispering) Okay. They were jacking me off. (his voice starts to rise again) They were leading me down this road. You know, this road?
>
> NIKKI: What road?
>
> RYAN: The road to nowhere.  You know the road.  The Nowhere Road.  I was being tugged along with this carrot. "Come here.  Come here.  Come here." But no one told me it was a f*cking cul-de-sac!  We've been on the  wrong road.
