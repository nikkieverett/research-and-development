      After being forced to be extra nice to each other in lieu of Ruby haunting
      us the entire time in Carlsbad, we decided to split time today doing
      activities each of us enjoy individually. Ryan went to play golf at Red
      Hawk Golf Club in Northern Las Cruces. Nikki grabbed coffee, walked around
      the local farmer's market and ate some delicious local tacos. üåÆ

      In hindsight, Nikki made the best choice of that day. Golf consisted of 25-30 mph sustained winds for about 15 of 18 holes with gusts to 60 mph. There were quite literally times where it was impossible to even swing the golf club. Ryan still shot 90 but came home from what felt like a boxing match rather than a round of golf. üèåÔ∏èü•ä

      By time we met back up at the adobe compound it was time for more food! This time we tried to check out the local Broken Spoke Taphouse (in honor of our Austin friends and family), but both the Broken Spoke and the adjoining bar and restaurant were closed and setting up a pretty large stage out back. We'd later find out that this was due to...graduation ceremonies? We believe the college and all the local schools were planning to host graduation as both places were closed for an entire week! So we settled for a little pizzeria/Italian restaurant around the corner. Awesome pizza, tasty margaritas, wonderful people and excellent service and the evening was capped off properly. üçïüç∏

      We walked back to the compound and decided to start season 4, part 2 of Ozark. Yes, the adobe compound had decent WiFi as well. No spoilers though please! Love y'all, be back tomorrow for another driving journey! ‚úåüèº
