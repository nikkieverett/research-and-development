      We got our best sleep of the entire trip so far last night so packing the
      car to head to Carlsbad, NM didn't seem all that bad this morning. It also
      helped that it was only 80 degrees. 😎


      We got the car packed up, checked out of Lajitas Golf Resort and were on the road by 10:30am local time. Possibly a new record for us!


      "I'm insane and responsible, this is a potent combination." - Albert Brooks as David Howard in Lost in America.


      Though we were sad to leave the views of Lajitas and Big Bend behind, we were very excited to see what adventures Carlsbad had in store for us. Boy were we in for some adventures!


      We tried listening to a podcast about the Black Dahlia murders along the way but had to turn it off due to the content being too gruesome. The full discography of The Lumineers would take over from there.


      We opted for the scenic route to Carlsbad to see (1) Marfa, TX and (2) Guadalupe Mountains National Park. We were trying to determine if it would be worth the trip to combine Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains in one day. We stopped at the Guadalupe Mountains Visitor Center, grabbed a map and did a very brisk and brief mile hike to stretch the legs. Honestly, we're not sure what people see in Marfa, TX and Guadalupe Mountains proved to be far underrated as a National Park, so surprises in both directions there.


      Driving into the town (or city?) of Carlsbad was a bit sketchy at first, but Nikki found us the best place in town to stay, The Trinity Hotel. Upon checking in, we were doubly glad to have turned off the Black Dahlia podcast from earlier that day. The building, which was built in 1892, was once a bank building with LOTS of history!


      The wonderful young lady that checked us in excitedly told us about our room and then went into several stories about the building being haunted 👻, most predominantly by a woman named Ruby who still resides in the hotel. All of the guest rooms were once offices, except Room 206 which was once the bank vault. Apparently Ruby is most active in 206 so we were glad to be in the opposite corner in 202 (not that it made it any easier to sleep...). 👀


      We unpacked the car and made it back down to the lobby around 5:15pm to have dinner in their restaurant (inside the same building). Justine, our amazing hostess and storyteller, gave us what she described as the "best table in the house." She could not have been more correct.


      The food was phenomenal, the {local} wine was fantastic and the service was excellent. Apparently The Trinity Hotel is the place to be in ALL of New Mexico. We had the Mayor of Carlsbad at the table behind us (the second best table in the house 😏) discussing some local politics with several people that looked like they were vying for his job. We also had a view of the Governor of New Mexico sitting downstairs. At one point she thought we were trying to take a picture of her. We were not. We just wanted a picture of the view from the best table in the house.


      The whole evening felt like we were in an episode of Goliath Season 3 (minus the casino). Later we found out the building also was the HQ for the Carlsbad Irrigation District for some time after the bank closed down which made for some additional deja vu. For those that know what we're talking about 👍. For all the others, we highly recommend watching Goliath. Amazon Prime Original. Worth the binge watch.


      We couldn't thank Justine enough for such a wonderful evening! Off to Carlsbad Caverns in the morning...if we make it to the morning (\*insert creepy laugh\*)

      The **1.25 mile (2 km)** Natural Entrance Trail is extremely steep.
      Depending on if you decide to hike up or down, you gain or lose about 750
      feet (229 m)—equivalent to walking up or down a 75-story building. The

      recommended for visitors with heart or respiratory conditions.*\

      \

      You have the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of early explorers as you see formations like Devil's Spring, the Whale's Mouth, and Iceberg Rock.


      The most popular route, the Big Room, is the largest single cave chamber by volume in North America. This **1.25 mile (2 km) trail** is relatively flat, and will take about **1.5 hours (on average) to walk it**. Actor and comedian Will Rogers called the cavern, "The Grand Canyon with a roof over it." You will be rewarded with spectacular views, cave formations of all shapes and sizes, and a rope ladder used by explorers in 1924.

  - title: Devil's Hall Trail
    subtitle: Guadalupe Mountains National Park

      wash which leads hikers to an impressive natural rock staircase leading to
      a "hallway" formed by steep canyon walls. The wash portion of the
      route requires the hiker to scramble over large boulders and other debris.
      This route offers spectacular views of geologic formations, steep canyon
      walls, tall trees, and mountaintops.
