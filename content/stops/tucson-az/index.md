    title: Day 10
    content: We're back in suburbia for now but Tucson is a pretty beautiful place!
      Definitely happy not to have to drive through crazy winds again for a
      little while. üôå <br /> <br /> Mondays are work days for the most part. We
      both have Monday meetings at 9:30am central time, which is 7:30am here in
      Tucson. Surprisingly we were both up around 6am and it really didn't feel
      early. We ‚ù§Ô∏è pacific time! A few meetings and some work on the website and
      we called it a day. <br /> <br /> After work we decided to get a hike in
      at Saguaro National Park West. Took about a 20 minute drive west from The
      Zen Den and found a trailhead called Gould Mine. The first part of the
      hike is straight uphill for a good two miles. Great scenery again along
      the way with some cliffside views that would rival any we've seen so far.
      <br /> <br /> The first half of the hike was straight uphill and we
      decided to modify the route a little bit to go straight back downhill
      through the canyon wash for the second half. We do keep finding ourselves
      in canyons right before sunset and have been warned of mountain lions so
      we should probably start getting out just a little earlier. We don't
      really want to be dinner for a mountain lion. üò¨  We did see our first
      confirmed rattlesnake on this hike as well; we're guessing it won't be the
      last one we see on this trip. <br /> <br /> We finished the hike just a
      shade before sunset started so the entire drive back across the mountain
      was bathed in golden light that eventually turned to lavender and violet
      hues. It was quite the sight! üåá  Definitely worth the impromptu hike in
      Saguaro National Park West! <br /> <br /> We got home and had ambitions of
      cooking a healthy dinner but the oven smelled so much like gas that we
      aborted that mission and went with Dominos Pizza instead. üçï Can't beat
      having Dominos at your fingertips while on the road. <br /> <br /> We may
      have a few shorter posts coming up as we get back into the real world for
      a few days. Nikki will be working, Ryan will be playing golf. Hopefully
      we'll get the chance to have some fun stories in between that we can share
      here. Cheers to a great start in Tucson!

    title: Day 11
    content: Not a ton of an update today. Early round of golf at The Golf Club at
      Dove Mountain. Really beautiful course and a very fun round. Didn't play
      particularly great but had fun nonetheless. Ended up playing with a lady
      from Toronto, Canada who was good company along the way. <br /> <br /> We
      made some dinner tonight and it was great to have a home cooked meal.
      (Let's be honest though, Nikki made dinner. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ) We decided to rest
      after dinner and ended up binge watching a bunch of movies. Early to bed,
      early to rise again tomorrow!

    title: Day 12
    content: Another short update for today. We're saving our energy for longer
      posts from Sedona and beyond! <br /> <br /> Got another early round of
      golf in, this time at Quarry Pines Golf Club. It was a shorter golf course
      but no shortage of views from around and in the quarry. Ended up being a
      really amazing golf course! <br /> <br /> After golf and Nikki finishing
      up work, we went downtown and had some great fish tacos and ahi tuna at a
      little Mexican seafood restaurant. Walked over and tried some local beers
      at Ten55 Brewery which was a good choice. Walked next door to Batch and
      had a last drink. Also bought our new friend Jake Jacobsen a bottle of
      local scotch to thank him for letting us stay at his place in Wickenburg
      the next couple of days. We're not entirely sure what to expect yet but we
      know it will be an adventure! Stay tuned for some updates coming from
      Wickenburg, AZ! ‚úåÔ∏è

      Awesome golf course built into an old rock quarry. Front nine was around
      the quarry, back nine was down and through the quarry. Incredible views!
