    title: Day 3
    content: >-
      Day three was our first day on a golf course during the trip so far and
      the views from our room had us excited to see what the rest of Black
      Jack's Crossing had in store for us. The views from the driving range
      alone gave us perspective that we were in for a really special round of
      golf.


      We got ready and checked in for an 11am tee time with Matt from Dallas, the course's head professional. He told the front nine goes straight out into the canyon with some really amazing views, but save our photography skills for the back nine. He also recommended that we drive up to the back tee boxes on holes 13, 14 and 15 to see the views.


      Matt was right. The views on the front nine were incredible. For any other golf course that would have been enough and every golfer would have been amazed, but this isn't just any golf course. We took Matt's advice and drove the treacherous cart paths up to the back tee boxes on every hole on the back nine. We're not sure there are words to fit the description of the views. Equal parts terrifying and awe inspiring is the best we can come up with for now. The pictures definitely don't do the course justice but we hope you like them just the same.


      To start the terrifying tee boxes, Hole #13 was a severely downhill par 3 with the green sitting what seemed like several hundred feet below us. Ryan hit a tee shot and walked off saying his heart was racing and adrenaline was pumping like he had just been in a boxing match. #14 and #15 gave you views of the Rio Grande river and the border of Mexico. Several people told us you could hit a golf ball into Mexico from #15 tee box. We opted to save the golf ball but the views definitely could not be beat.


      After 18 holes, we decided to split up and conquer our own individual passions. One of us stayed on the golf course and played another 18 holes 🏌🏼‍♂️ while the other went back to the room and worked on this website. We imagine you can guess who did what. 💁‍♀️


      For you golfers out there...Ryan shot 84 twice in a row. Just finishing 36 holes in one day in the desert with temps hovering around 100 is a feat. The second time around the front nine he shot 38 with a birdie and a double bogey. Pretty amazing stuff.


      We had such an incredible day with views that we may never see again on a golf course that might be one of the best on the planet as far as we're concerned. We both loaded up the aloe and lotion after a long day in the sun. Next up...a day back in Big Bend National Park! ✌🏼

hiking:
  - title: Tuff Canyon Trail
    subtitle: Big Bend National Park
    length: .75 miles
    elevation: 200 feet
    time: 1 hour
    difficulty: Easy

      A short walk along the rim of Tuff Canyon leads to three viewing
      platforms. 


      This short hike highlights some of the varied and interesting rock formations that can be found in Big Bend. Start off near the waypoint marked "Trailhead" and follow the path of the trail towards the southwest. Off in the distance sits Castellan Mountain, which dominates the sky in this part of the park. 


      An exhibit at the east (right-hand) overlook explains how the sheer walls of the canyon were formed. The trail between the overlooks is rock and gravel, with some steps near the western viewing platforms.

    length: 1.4 miles
    elevation: 157 feet
    time: 35 mins
    difficulty: Easy

      This trail begins at the end of the Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive at a paved
      parkng area. Although a short trail, it is one of the grandest spectacles
      in the park. After crossing Terlingua Creek, the trail climbs several
      short switchbacks and then gradually descends along the banks of the Rio
      Grande. Hikers are surrounded by lush riparian vegetation and 1,500-foot
      towering vertical cliffs of solid limestone. The trail ends where canyon
      walls meet the river. Take a lunch and enjoy the scene. The average time
      to completion is 1 hour.


      Following rains, flash floods, or periods of high water, Terlingua creek can be impassable, effectively closing the trail.
